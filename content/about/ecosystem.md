The ecosystem consists of a stand-alone application (MakeHuman), assets and tools implemented as addons inside Blender.

## Main applications

There are two applications for modeling humans:

* [MakeHuman]({{< relref "../MakeHuman" >}}): A stand-alone GUI program for modeling 3d humans
* [MPFB]({{< relref "../MPFB" >}}): A blender add-on for modeling 3d humans

## Tools for creating assets

The toolset for creating new assets come in the form of Blender addons:

* [MakeClothes]({{< relref "../Assets/CreatingAssets/MakeClothes" >}}): A tool for creating clothes, hairstyles and alternative topologies
* [MakeTarget]({{< relref "../Assets/CreatingAssets/MakeTarget" >}}): A tool for creating morphs
* MakeSkin: A tool for creating materials, such as skins

Note that these tools are also bundled with MPFB, so if you already have MPFB installed, you do not need to download the standalone versions.
