The MakeHuman community is centered around the MakeHuman core assets (such as the Basemesh), the tools that operates on these (such as
[MakeHuman]({{< relref "../MakeHuman" >}}) and [MPFB]({{< relref "../MPFB" >}})) 
and the [user contributed assets](http://www.makehumancommunity.org/content/user_contributed_assets.html) that extends and enhances them.
