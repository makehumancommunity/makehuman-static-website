The MakeHuman community is centered around the MakeHuman [core assets]({{< relref "core_assets" >}}), the tools that operates on these
and the [user contributed assets]({{< relref "user_contributed_assets" >}}) that extends and enhances them.

For more information about how these parts relate to each other, see the [ecosystem]({{< relref "ecosystem" >}}) page.

## Tools

The most salient parts of the community are the tools:

* [MakeHuman]({{< relref "../MakeHuman" >}}): A stand-alone GUI program for modeling 3d humans
* [MPFB]({{< relref "../MPFB" >}}): A blender add-on for modeling 3d humans

Both MakeHuman and MPFB are [free and open source programs]({{< relref "license" >}}).

## Core assets

The core assets consist of a base mesh, morphs, skins, alternative topologies and some sample clothes. See 
the [concepts]({{< relref "Concepts" >}}) section for more information about these.

## User contributed assets

There is also a large library with assets, such as clothes and hairstyles, contributed by users in the community.
See the [assets]({{< relref "../Assets" >}}) section for more information about these.
