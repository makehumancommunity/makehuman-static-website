Assets come in two categories: 

* Core assets: These are the assets bundled with MakeHuman, and in the makehuman system assets pack for MPFB
* User contributed assets: These are third part assets contributed by users of MakeHuman and MPFB

If you are looking for assets to download, see [downloading assets]({{< relref "DownloadAssets" >}}) for general information, or [asset packs]({{< relref "AssetPacks" >}}) 
if you are looking for download links.

For the creation of assets see:

* [MakeClothes]({{< relref "MakeClothes" >}}): Information on the standalone MakeClothes tool
