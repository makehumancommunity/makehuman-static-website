Asset packs are zip files with checked assets from MakeHuman and the asset repositories. You can download these to quickly get up and running with a basic set of assets.

MPFB2 users will want at least the "Makehuman system assets".

See the [asset packs FAQ]({{% relref "faq" %}}) for more information on asset packs.

## Secondary mirror

Please only use this if the download links on the subpages above do not work. The mirror has a much tighter traffic quota and there's a risk it might
get shut down if overloaded. 

The secondary mirror is [here](http://files2.makehumancommunity.org)

The primary download site and the mirror are on two different ISPs in different parts of the country. If you still have trouble downloading, the best 
guess is that there's a routing issue on your side or between you and Sweden.
