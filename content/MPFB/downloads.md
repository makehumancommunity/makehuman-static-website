## What should you download?

At this point in the development, the nightly build and the latest release build (beta 2) are pretty much exactly the same. As there
is no functional difference between a release build and a nightly build, you might as well download the nightly build to get
the latest bugfixes.

Note that in order to get the most out of MPFB2, you will probably also want to download
a few [Asset Packs]({{% relref "../../Assets/AssetPacks" %}})

### IMPORTANT: New location of user files

If you upgrade from a version from before 2025-01-21, note that MPFB will now look for your user data in a different location. If you do not take specific action
when upgrading, then it will appear as if your data has gone missing. There is a FAQ on how to fix this at
[My user files disappeared after upgrading MPFB]({{% relref "FAQ/user_files_disappeared" %}})

### IMPORTANT: MPFB is now an extension rather than an addon

After 2024-10-12, the format of MPFB2 has changed. Whereas it was previously a legacy addon, it is now an extension.

If you upgrade from a very old version, you should read at least [What do I need to do when upgrading from addon to extension?]({{% relref "FAQ/upgrade_to_addon" %}})

## Primary mirror

This is where you can usually download MPFB2.

- Nightly builds can be found in the [plugins]({{% param "primaryFilesUrl" %}}/plugins/) directory. Look for the file called mpfb2-*.zip.
- Release builds can be found in the [releases]({{% param "primaryFilesUrl" %}}/releases/) directory. 

## Secondary mirror

If the above does not work, you can also try this mirror. 

- Nightly builds can be found in the [plugins]({{% param "secondaryFilesUrl" %}}/plugins/) directory. Look for the file called mpfb2-*.zip.
- Release builds can be found in the [releases]({{% param "secondaryFilesUrl" %}}/releases/) directory.
