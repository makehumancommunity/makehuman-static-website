## What should you download?

At this point in the development, the nightly build and the latest release build (beta 1) are pretty much exactly the same. As there
is no functional difference between a release build and a nightly build, you might as well download the nightly build to get
the latest bugfixes.

Note that in order to get the most out of MPFB2, you will probably also want to download
a few [Asset Packs]({{% relref "../../Assets/AssetPacks" %}})

### Blender 4.1 now required

After may 7, 2024, all nightly builds require at least blender 4.1. There is no longer any specific blender4 nightly build.

## Primary mirror

This is where you can usually download MPFB2.

- Nightly builds can be found in the [plugins]({{% param "primaryFilesUrl" %}}/plugins/) directory. Look for the file called mpfb2-*.zip.
- Release builds can be found in the [releases]({{% param "primaryFilesUrl" %}}/releases/) directory. 

## Secondary mirror

If the above does not work, you can also try this mirror. 

- Nightly builds can be found in the [plugins]({{% param "secondaryFilesUrl" %}}/plugins/) directory. Look for the file called mpfb2-*.zip.
- Release builds can be found in the [releases]({{% param "secondaryFilesUrl" %}}/releases/) directory.
