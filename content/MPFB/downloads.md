## What should you download?

Since [the release of 2.0.8]({{% relref "Releases/release_208" %}}), the recommended way of installing MPFB is via 
[the extension platform](https://extensions.blender.org/add-ons/mpfb/). Most, if not all users are recommended to use this
rather then downloading a standalone binary.

Note that in order to get the most out of MPFB2, you will probably also want to download
a few [Asset Packs]({{% relref "../../Assets/AssetPacks" %}}). These need to be downloaded separately.

The links further down on this page leads to older releases and nightly builds.

### IMPORTANT: Switching to the extension platform

If you have previously installed a nightly build or an older release, then you should read 
[What should I do when switching to the extension platform version?]({{% relref "FAQ/switching_to_platform" %}}).

### IMPORTANT: New location of user files

If you upgrade from a version from before 2025-01-21, note that MPFB will now look for your user data in a different location. If you do not take specific action
when upgrading, then it will appear as if your data has gone missing. There is a FAQ on how to fix this at
[My user files disappeared after upgrading MPFB]({{% relref "FAQ/user_files_disappeared" %}})

### IMPORTANT: MPFB is now an extension rather than an addon

After 2024-10-12, the format of MPFB2 has changed. Whereas it was previously a legacy addon, it is now an extension.

If you upgrade from a very old version, you should read at least [What do I need to do when upgrading from addon to extension?]({{% relref "FAQ/upgrade_to_addon" %}})

## Primary mirror

This is where you can usually download MPFB2.

- Nightly builds can be found in the [plugins]({{% param "primaryFilesUrl" %}}/plugins/) directory. Look for the file called mpfb2-*.zip.
- Release builds can be found in the [releases]({{% param "primaryFilesUrl" %}}/releases/) directory. 

## Secondary mirror

If the above does not work, you can also try this mirror. 

- Nightly builds can be found in the [plugins]({{% param "secondaryFilesUrl" %}}/plugins/) directory. Look for the file called mpfb2-*.zip.
- Release builds can be found in the [releases]({{% param "secondaryFilesUrl" %}}/releases/) directory.
