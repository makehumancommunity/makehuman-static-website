## What should you download?

At this point in the development, there is no fundamental difference between a "nightly build" and a "release build". 
A release build is simply a nightly build which was renamed at a point in time. It will thus usually make most sense
to always download a nightly build.

Note that in order to get the most out of MPFB2, you will probably also want to download
a few [Asset Packs]({{< relref "../../Assets/AssetPacks" >}})

## Primary mirror

This is where you can usually download MPFB2.

- Nightly builds can be found in the [plugins](http://files.makehumancommunity.org/plugins/) directory. Look for the file called mpfb2-*.zip.
- Release builds can be found in the [releases](http://files.makehumancommunity.org/releases/) directory. 

## Secondary mirror

If the above does not work, you can also try this mirror. 

- Nightly builds can be found in the [plugins](http://files2.makehumancommunity.org/plugins/) directory. Look for the file called mpfb2-*.zip.
- Release builds can be found in the [releases](http://files2.makehumancommunity.org/releases/) directory. 

Please don't use this mirror unless it is necessary, as it has a data cap.
