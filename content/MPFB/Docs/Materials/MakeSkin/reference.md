description: "All keys available in the MakeSkin spec"

The following is an overview of how the MakeSkin material model fits into MHMAT, Blender and MakeHuman.

"Visible in blender" means that the material feature can be represented in such a way that it would make a visible difference 
in Blender (even if this has not been implemented by MakeSkin yet). "Visible in MH" means that the feature will make a visible 
difference in MakeHuman, under the right conditions (not all shaders in MH support all material features). 

It should be especially noted that the MHMAT model is wider than what is actually implemented in MakeHuman, so there are 
several keys that are supported by MHMAT, but which makes no visible difference at all in MakeHuman.

On the opposite end it should be noted that a few keys have been added to make the handling in blender more smooth. These
keys are outside the MHMAT spec and will not make a visible difference in MakeHuman. They will, however, survive the roundtrip
to blender: If you use makeskin (or MPFB with makeskin enabled) when importing, you will get the settings set in blender.

For more details, see the respective key's documentation.

There are also a bunch of other shaderParam settings which are not listed here. They are usually consequences of the above, such as "normal" 
for saying whether we should take the normal map into account. MakeSkin will infer this from whether the texture is set or not.
