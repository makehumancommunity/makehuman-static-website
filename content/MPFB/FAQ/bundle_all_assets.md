title: "Why can't you simply bundle all assets in the addon?"

There are a few variations of this question, but basically the viewpoint is that it is cumbersome to 
download asset packs and that the suggested solution is to bundle all existing assets in the extension
platform downloadable.

This is not a viable approach, as it would make the addon several gigabytes large. This is far outside
the intended size bracket of addons on the extension platform. It would also prevent people on slow 
connections from installing MPFB.
