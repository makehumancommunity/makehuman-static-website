On the model tab, there is a button "refit assets to basemesh" and a checkbox "auto refit assets". Either click the button after a model change
to update all assets to the latest shape. Or, if you have enough power in your machine, check the checkbox and have the change apply automatically. The last
option might become cumbersome if you have clothes with dense meshes equipped.
