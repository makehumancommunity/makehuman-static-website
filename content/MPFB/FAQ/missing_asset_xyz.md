This is a confusion that tends to arise when encountering MPFB, when being used to commercial software with commercial asset libraries. 
The misconception is that the dev team behind MPFB is also the authors of all the available assets, that the available assets are
conceptually a part of MPFB, or that MPFB as such is limited because it doesn't have a particular asset.

It is important to realize that (with the exception of the system assets) _all assets are provided by users in the community_. 
When someone has a new asset they wish to share, they upload it 
to [the asset repository](http://www.makehumancommunity.org/content/user_contributed_assets.html).
This is a library of assets which is shared between MPFB, MakeHuman and the other open source softwares build around the asset standards.

The asset packs are simply user contributed assets which have been bundled together for convenience. The basic principle
is that when someone needs an asset, they either make it or they ask someone else in the community to make it. The dev
team does not usually design assets.

All tools that are needed to create assets for MPFB are available inside MPFB, under the "create assets" panel.
