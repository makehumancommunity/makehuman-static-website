In the intro video, functionality for changing colors on a material is demonstrated. To use this functionality, you 
need to use the "procedural eyes" material for eyes or the "enhanced" material for skin. 

In late 2024, the default material was changed. If you do not say otherwise, you will get the "MakeSkin" material model
for both eyes and skin.

You can set which material model you want to use per default on "Apply assets" -> "Library settings" -> "Materials".
This will be used the next time you add an asset (such as adding eyes or loading a skin).
