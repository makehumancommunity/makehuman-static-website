A reasonable question when choosing a human character generator is why you should choose MPFB over something else.

The short answer here is that if MPFB fits your particular use case, then use it. If something else fits your use case better, then use that. 

If all what you want or need is something quick and simple for getting a humanoid mesh, then maybe Human Primitives is an alternative. If you want something photorealistic that integrates with Unreal Engine, then maybe Meta Human is a good fit. There are many options available, and it might be worth the effort to evaluate them. 

The slightly longer answer is that the following might be reasons to use MPFB over something else:

- If you like Blender and want a fully integrated intermediate to advanced tool with a lot of abilities, MPFB will offer that to you. There's a simple one-click-create-mesh solution included too, but there's a lot you can do after having added the basic human.
- You might want to play around with different materials, which range from PBR texture based to fully procedural.
- MPFB offers humanoid solution fully integrated with rigify.
- MPFB supports Mixamo animations.
- MPFB is a true open source project, not a marketing gimmick. There is no hidden premium tier and no-one here is going to try to sell you anything.
- The MPFB asset license is as permissive as it gets. If you want to use assets without any fear of license problems, then you won't find a more permissive project. The core assets are CC0, and you don't need to read and accept a 64-page long EULA to use them.
- You might be interested in using the [large library of third-part assets]({{% relref "../../Assets/AssetPacks" %}}) such as clothes and skins. They're a few clicks away, and they are for free, with very permissive licenses (CC0 or CC-BY).
- The MakeHuman community has been at it for something akin to 20 years now. Maybe longevity in a project might be appealing too?
