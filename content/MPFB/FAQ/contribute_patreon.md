No.

The Makehuman Community maintains a [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/makehuman) which accepts voluntary donations.

There is no requirement whatsoever to donate money, neither morally nor legally. 

The Patreon page is there so that the project at least does not operate at a loss. The Patreon money largely covers
hosting and domain name costs.
