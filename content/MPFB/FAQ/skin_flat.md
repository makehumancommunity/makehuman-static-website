In a change in december 2024, the default skin model was set to "MakeSkin". This is a plain image texture based material 
without any particular procedural aspects. 

You can change which skin model to use under "apply assets" -> "library settings" -> "materials". The skin of the character
will change when loading a new skin after having changed the setting.

For an overview of the different materials, see [Materials]({{% relref "../Docs/Materials" %}})
