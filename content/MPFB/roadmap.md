MPFB version 2 has now been released as stable on the extension platform. 

The roadmap has no dates in place, since the development is all on volunteer basis and happens when people have time. Best tip if you
want things to go faster is to jump in and help the project along, see [contributing to MPFB]({{% relref "Contributing" %}}).

The following is a rough overview of development efforts planned in the future.

- Randomizing humans
- Translation of the UI to other languages
- Support BlenRig
- Support Faceit
- Geometry nodes / particle hair
- Wrinkle maps
- Update the online asset repository to future-proof it
- Provide integration with the online asset repository so assets can be uploaded/downloaded to/from the repo from inside blender
