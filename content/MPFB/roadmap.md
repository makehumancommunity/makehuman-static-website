MPFB version 2 is currently in beta (see [release notes for 2.0-beta1]({{% relref "Releases/release_20b1" %}}) for the latest release).

At the moment, the plan is that the [next version]({{% relref "Releases/release_next" %}}) will be the stable 2.0.x release. It something arises, there might be a second beta though.

The roadmap has no dates in place, since the development is all on volunteer basis and happens when people have time. Best tip if you
want things to go faster is to jump in and help the project along, see [contributing to MPFB]({{% relref "Contributing" %}}).

But the following is a rough overview of the nearest future.

## MPFB 2.0 stable release

**Main focus:** Providing a polished experience for users and releasing something which is viable for a longer term support. Stomping out remaining bugs. Test thoroughly before stable release.

**Other planned efforts:**

- Add enough unit test coverage to be able to be comfortable when new blender versions are released
- Writing documentation and guides
- Launch on blender extensions platform. It is not obvious that the format and scope of MPFB fits there though.

## MPFB 2.1 (and later)

These plans are very uncertain, but there are things which should ideally be done:

- Translation of the UI to other languages
- Support BlenRig
- Support Faceit
- Geometry nodes / particle hair
- Wrinkle maps
- Update the online asset repository to future-proof it
- Provide integration with the online asset repository so assets can be uploaded/downloaded to/from the repo from inside blender
