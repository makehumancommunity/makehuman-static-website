These pages contain code documentation and general hints for people who want to help develop MPFB.

## Getting the code

The code repository is at https://github.com/makehumancommunity/mpfb2. The addon zip is a simple 
archive of the "mpfb" [subdirectory of the src folder](https://github.com/makehumancommunity/mpfb2/tree/master/src/mpfb). 

The code is editor agnostic, although PyDev has been used when writing it. 

## Introductory material

These are some general doc pages you might want to read before digging into the code:

* [Code structure]({{% relref "code_structure" %}}): A description of how the code is organized, and where to find things

## Specific areas of the code

* [Rigging and posing]({{% relref "rigging_and_posing" %}}): A description of how the rigging and posing functionality works
