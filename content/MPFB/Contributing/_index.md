MPFB is a free and open source project. Everything in the project is based on volunteer efforts. 

If you want to participate in the development of MPFB, there are a few things you can do. 
There are tasks for both developers and artists.

The following is by no means a complete list. If there is something else you want to add to the project,
then just add a 
[feature request](https://github.com/makehumancommunity/mpfb2/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=) or open a
[pull request](https://github.com/makehumancommunity/mpfb2/compare).

Suggestions for what to do is split up into these categories:

- [Testing and suggesting improvements]({{< relref "testing" >}}). These are good tasks for getting to know MPFB2 and which do not require any prior knowledge or coding skills.
- [Contributing code]({{< relref "coding" >}}). If you are primarily a developer, then these are tasks which do not require mixed skills.
- [Art and graphics]({{< relref "art" >}}). If you are primarily an artist with no interest in coding, then these are tasks which do not require touching code.

The easiest way to get in contact to discuss contributions is via the [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/makehuman) for general discussions, or by
opening an issue on GitHub for specific features or suggestions.
