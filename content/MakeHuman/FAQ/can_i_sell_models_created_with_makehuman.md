Yes.

From the license section that applies to the exported models:

  You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.

The exported models end up being licensed [CC0 (Creative Commons Zero)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). This is basically the most liberal license in the world, and for all practical purposes it places no restrictions on the licensee.

The full license text is available at https://github.com/makehumancommunity/makehuman/blob/master/LICENSE.md

**Do I have to pay anything to use the exported model in a commercial setting?**

**Do I need a separate commercial license in order to use exported models in a commercial setting?**
