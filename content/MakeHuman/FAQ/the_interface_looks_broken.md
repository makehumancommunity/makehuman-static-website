title: "The interface looks broken"
draft: false

There are circumstances where not all graphics cards support all settings. Some of these settings are desired on other graphics cards. 

If you have problem with the 3d canvas being empty (no character is showing), or the 3d canvas seems to contain repeated fragments of the other parts of the interface, you can try to disable these settings. 

Go to the Settings -> General tab. First try to check "no sample buffers" and restart makehuman. If the problem persist, try to also check "no shaders" and restart makehuman. 

If things still are not working after this, please send us a log file: see [How to provide a log for a good bug report?]({{% relref "how_to_provide_a_makehuman_log_for_a_good_bug_report" %}})
