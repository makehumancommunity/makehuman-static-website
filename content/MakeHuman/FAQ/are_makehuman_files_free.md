Yes. The asset license is [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/). In practice this imposes no restriction on your use of the core assets, be they
used through MakeHuman or copied through some other means. 

For example you can:

* Use a character model in a closed source game without need for attribution
* Sell a character model
* Take all mesh and target assets and build a character generator of your own, with no restriction on what license that character generator needs to have
