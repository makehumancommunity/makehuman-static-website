The answer is somewhere between yes and no.

Yes, there is a new major version of MakeHuman in the works. It has the temporary nick name [MakeHuman pyside6](https://github.com/makehumancommunity/makehuman-pyside6). 
Conceptually this can be thought of as MakeHuman 2. It is available via git and can be started.

But no, there is no _functional_ version 2 of MakeHuman. The new version still has some ways to go before being a useful replacement for the old code base (ie 1.3.0).
