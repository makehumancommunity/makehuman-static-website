Thanks to user Eray Ocak, there is now a mac build available.

Regarding features, this release is roughly equivalent to [[Releases:120|the official 1.2.0 build for windows and linux]]. The following are specific notes regarding the build for MacOS.

The first issue you are likely to run into, is that you might get an error message saying the application cannot be scanned for malicious software. This is because it isn't signed with a commercial certificate (which we don't have since we're a volunteer project without much of a budget). To get around this, see https://thewiredshopper.com/apple-cannot-check-for-malicious-software-error/

The build can be downloaded from [mirror 1]({{% param "primaryFilesUrl" %}}/releases/makehuman-community-1.2.0-macos.zip)
or [mirror 2]({{% param "secondaryFilesUrl" %}}/releases/makehuman-community-1.2.0-macos.zip)

Generally speaking, this is a very old build with limited support. If you run into trouble, it is recommended to try to run from source
instead.
