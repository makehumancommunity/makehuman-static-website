MakeHuman is a tool designed to simplify the creation of virtual humans using a Graphical User Interface, also commonly referred to as a GUI.
This is a specialized branch of the more general subject of 3D modelling. The MakeHuman Team is focused on this specific branch of the broader 
subject in order to achieve the best possible ease of use in that area. The ultimate goal is to be able to quickly produce a wide array of virtual 
humans with only a few clicks of the mouse and be able to render or export them for use in other projects.

Humans are created through the manipulation of controls that allow for the blending of different human attributes to create unique 3D human characters. 
The controls are intended to provide the user with a simple way to create characters that give expression to a wide range of human forms. 
The controllable attributes are broken into two groups: macro and detail. The macro targets deal with overall human characteristics like gender, 
age, height, weight and ethnicity. The detail targets allow for the character to be further refined by focusing on the low level details of such things 
as the eye's shape or finger's length.

The MakeHuman project strives to provide a complete tool that allows for the management of all things needed to create virtual humans. 
With the exception of modeling, most of these tools follow a "point and click" approach by using the MakeHuman's Library.
MakeHuman also offers tools for exporting virtual humans to other software (such as the Blender 3D modeling suite) where further refinements can be made.
