## System Requirements

You will need about half a gigabyte of free disk space. 

In order to use some realtime materials and obtain the best from the internal rendering engine, it's required an average quality graphic card, produced after the year 2006. In general, your graphics card should support OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) version 1.2 or above. 

## Windows

Download the zip file from the from the [releases page]({{% relref "../Releases" %}}). Then unzip it and double click on makehuman.exe to install the application.

## Mac OS X

Download the DMG file from the download page [download page](http://www.makehuman.org/download.php). Once downloaded, mount the disk image and drag the MakeHuman app into your Applications folder. MakeHuman supports Snow Leopard and newer.

## Linux

At the point of writing this, the newest stable release is only available via [PPA](https://launchpad.net/~makehuman-official/+archive/ubuntu/makehuman-community). This should work on all debian derivatives.

Other Linux distributions will need to run from source.

## Installing from source

If you want to play around with the code, follow the latest development, or are having trouble with the prepackaged binaries you can run from a source clone from GitHub. This requires that you have installed python 3.4+ and a set of other dependencies. See [the README in the git repo](https://github.com/makehumancommunity/makehuman/blob/master/README.md)
