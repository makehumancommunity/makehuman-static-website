## 2024-12-01: Updates to MakeHuman documentation

A spirited attempt has been made to get the MakeHuman part of these pages in order. Particularly the
[MakeHuman FAQ]({{< relref "MakeHuman/FAQ" >}}) has gotten a face lift, but there have also been numerous changes
under the [MakeHuman Docs]({{< relref "MakeHuman/Docs" >}})

## 2024-11-10: MPFB 2.0 beta 2 has been released

MPFB 2.0 beta 2 has been released. See [release notes for 2.0 beta 2]({{< relref "MPFB/Releases/release_20b2" >}}) for more info
and [the download page]({{< relref "MPFB/downloads" >}}) for download links.

## 2024-10-12: MPFB is now an "extension"

Important notice: Starting from today, the nightly builds of MPFB are "extensions" rather than "legacy addons". From a user point of view, this looks the same in the end. But when upgrading from one to the other, there are some things that need to be done. 

There is a FAQ entry about this at [How do I upgrade from addon to extension?]({{< relref "MPFB/FAQ/upgrade_to_addon" >}}).

## 2024-07-23: MPFB 2.0 beta 1 has been released

MPFB 2.0 beta 1 has been released. See [release notes for 2.0 beta 1]({{< relref "MPFB/Releases/release_20b1" >}}) for more info
and [the download page]({{< relref "MPFB/downloads" >}}) for download links.

## 2024-06-23: MPFB now supports BVH-style poses

MPFB now supports MakeHuman BVH poses (ie the poses which are available from the asset repo), and there are two asset packs with poses available. 

You need a nightly build from 2024-06-23 (today) or later to be able to load these. 

The pose loading functionality has some limitations as of yet: You can only use them with the default skeleton, and they will mess around a bit with the bone rolls. But it works well enough for static posing.

For download links for the nightly build, see [the download page]({{< relref "MPFB/downloads" >}})

For download links for the asset packs, see [the asset packs page]({{< relref "Assets/AssetPacks" >}})

For preliminary release notes for the next upcoming release, see [the preliminary release notes]({{< relref "MPFB/Releases/release_next" >}})

## 2024-05-11: MakeHuman 1.3.0 has been released

MakeHuman 1.3.0 has been released. See [the release notes]({{< relref "MakeHuman/Releases/releases_130" >}}) for more information and download links.
